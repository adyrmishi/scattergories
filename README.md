# Scattergories - Replica

Deployed at [https://scattergories-replica.netlify.app/](https://scattergories-replica.netlify.app/)

## Summary

Heavily inspired by [https://swellgarfo.com/scattergories/](https://swellgarfo.com/scattergories/). This is a project I've made for practise and to adapt the game to the way me and my friends play it! It's not for profit and should be treated as a project I've created to develop my web development skills.

## Instructions

Prerequisites: Someone other than yourself.

1. Split into teams and decide how many rounds you want to play and how long a round should be (30 seconds works well).
2. Once a category is generated, both teams should start a bidding war on who can name the most of the category. Once someone refuses to beat the bid, the highest bidder must attempt to match or beat their bid.
3. If the person matches or beats the bid, their team gets a point - if not, the other team gets the point.
4. Team with the most points wins.

## What I've Learnt

- Using Supabase to create a serverless database. Due to the small nature of the project, and the limited ways I needed to change the data I thought it would be more efficient to use a BaaS platform. It was incredibly easy to use and a great option for any project that is more front-end focused.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
